# RedBlueStack
Two sided stack implementation

Implementation of two stacks, red and blue, that use the same array
The red and blue stacks have their own push and pop operations and grow
from opposite sides until there is no more room left in the stack causing
an overflow error. Each method runs in constant time O(1)
